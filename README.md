# Fortune's Malaria_Model

After working on the MNIST and FashionMNIST datasets, I decided to work on some "**real-life-application**" dataset. I checked paperswithcode.com for some datasets. I was fortunate enough to find a paper that worked on a malaria dataset, I then decided to work on that same malaria dataset.

The name of the paper is Malaria Parasite Detection using Efficient Neural Ensembles. Its a pretty straight forward paper. I'm not yet an expert in the whole **academic-paper-reading** pursuit but the paper was quite an easy read and not unnecessarily long.



N.B: Daniel Bourke's youtube videos helped me to get a proper foundation in the whole neural network thing and I got the data from krishnaik06 github... 

Thanks for coming to my corner of the internet.
